# Apivolve generator API

This project is part of Apivolve, more details about that in https://github.com/mverleg/apivolve .

If you want to create your own code generator for Apivolve, you do not need to extend Apivolve, just this small library is enough.

It contains the Rust types that Apivolve uses to describe the API, as well as the boilerplate code for requesting and parsing this data.
