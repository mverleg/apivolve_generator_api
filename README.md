# Apivolve generator API

This project is part of [Apivolve](https://github.com/mverleg/apivolve).

If you want to create your own code generator for Apivolve in Rust, you do not need to extend Apivolve, just this small library is enough.

It contains the Rust types that Apivolve uses to describe the API, the boilerplate code for requesting and parsing this data, as well as an example (`debug_dump.rs`).
